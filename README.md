# Welcome! :wave:

Glad you're here. My name is Luciano, currently living in Argentina.

I hold an MSc. in Computer Science from _National University of Rosario_, with a strong focus in intelligent agents (read more about that at [https://dcc.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~lperezzini](https://dcc.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~lperezzini)). 

I __love__ to create new technology-based services and products, mainly from scratch, with committed teams. Launched my own [start-up](https://prommapp.com) and _failed_; worked on AI, Cloud Computing, Natural Language Processing, XaaS, RegTech and AgTech projects.
